## **Personal Protective Equipment**

This project is an implementation of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) object detection using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection. The goal of this project is to detect and classify different PPE items, such as helmets, vests, goggles, and masks, in video streams.

## **Tech Stack Used**

  * Python 3.9
  * OpenCV
  * Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
  * FastAPI
    
## **Use Case**

### Construction Site Access Control:
The model can be employed at entry and exit points of construction sites to identify and grant access only to authorized personnel wearing the proper safety gear, helping to maintain a safe working environment and prevent unauthorized access.
