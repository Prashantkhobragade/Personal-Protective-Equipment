# **Personal Protective Equipment**

This project is an implementation of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) object detection using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection. The goal of this project is to detect and classify different PPE items, such as helmets, vests, goggles, and masks, in video streams.

# **Requirements**

  * Python 3.9
  * OpenCV
  * Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
  * FastAPI
